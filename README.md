# Scale-AV Monitoring Computer

**Note:** This is a work in progress, designed in preparation for Scale 15x (March, 2017).


This repository holds the python, GStreamer, and GTK+ reworking of the ScaleAV video stream monitoring software. This solution has several advantages above the original solution:

- **Unified Window and Event code:**
  The same solution handels the tracking of window events, and the window display removing the need for external event tracking.
- **GStreamer:**
  GStreamer allows greater control over the incoming streams, and provides a lightweight alternative to VLC windows. This will yield better performance in the post XVideo-driver systems. GStreamer usage replaces several technologies including Jack Audio, and VLC with a single technology choice.
- **Python:** 
  A unified solution in python replaces a multi-language, multi-technology stack, which reduces the learning curve and minimizes the codebase. This allows for easier maintainability in a volunteer-staffed environment.

## Known Bugs
- Windows are designed to regenerate when killed, forcing an external process termination
- If a window is killed too quickly after regneration, property-not-found errors may arise due to incomplete initialization
